The following are my solutions to the Case Study 3 Foodie Fie questions in 
[Danny Ma's Serious SQL course](https://www.datawithdanny.com/ "Data With Danny")
<br/>
<br/>
Danny has shared with you 6 key datasets for this case study :
[Data Set](https://github.com/Shailesh-python/Case_Study_3_Pizza_Runner/blob/main/Datasets%20and%20Tables)
<br/>
- `plans`
- `subscriptions`
<br/>

## A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

## B. Data Analysis Questions

## [Question #1](#case-study-questions)
> How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
